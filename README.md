Welcome to the miniProjects wiki!

I have ported a bunch of projects, which I will always store at {projectname}/pysrc

You must have Java 15 installed for this application to work, get AdoptOpenJDk 15 or OracleJDK 15 The Java Source is also availiable at {projectname}/src.

The jar wil be at {projectname}/out/artifacts/{projectname}
