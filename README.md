## Welcome to the miniProjects wiki!


**THIS VERSION IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED, USE V2 AT https://github.com/JeffAxe123/miniProjets/v2**
I have ported a bunch of projects, which I will always store at {projectname}/pysrc

You must have Java 15 installed for this application to work, get [AdoptOpenJDk 15](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk15-binaries/releases/download/jdk-15.0.2%2B7/OpenJDK15U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_15.0.2_7.msi)
or [OracleJDK 15](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)
The Java Source is also availiable at {projectname}/src.

The jar wil be at {projectname}/out/artifacts/{projectname}
