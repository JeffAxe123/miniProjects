## Welcome to the miniProjects wiki!

This is the updated versoin of the project.


I have ported a bunch of projects, which I will always store at games/{projectname}/pysrc

You must have Java 15 installed for this application to work, get [AdoptOpenJDk 15](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk15-binaries/releases/download/jdk-15.0.2%2B7/OpenJDK15U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_15.0.2_7.msi)
or [OracleJDK 15](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)
The Java Source is also availiable at {projectname}/src.

The jar wil be at games/{projectname}/bin/{projectname}.jar
